# Dielectric Heterodimer Simulation and Fano Fit Analysis

## Overview

This Python project simulates the optical response of a two-sphere dielectric heterodimer using an electric-dipole coupled-dipole model. The simulation includes Mie coefficient calculations, electric dipole polarizability, extinction spectra, and Fano fit analysis. Dispersion effects of materials like crystalline silicon (Si) are incorporated.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed, and then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
